![Andrii][img1]

Welcome to my website! 
My name is Andrii and I'm a professional Drupal developer and tech-lead from Ukraine with more than 10 years of experience. I've created this website to share my experience in various subjects like [Drupal][drupal-org], Algorithms, Data Structures, Coding Exercises (HackerRank, Leetcode, etc.), JavaScript, modern web development trends and more.

In my free time, I like to plan my future travels with my lovely wife. Also, I'm dreaming about building an autonomous camper van and travel around Europe. Maybe I will post my travel experience here in the blog. Stay tuned!

If you want me to help you with your exciting web project - feel free to [hire me][mailto] for consulting or actual development. You can check my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin-profile] for more information about my experience and finished projects as well as feedback from my colleagues. 

Also you can find me on [GitHub][github-profile], [BitBucket][bitbucket-profile] and [Drupal.org][drupal-profile].
